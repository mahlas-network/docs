Funding can happen in two possible ways; time and money.
These possibilities can happen partial and might happen at the same time.

A belief in a Mahlas is not a donation.
It is a risk/reward system. *What is the risk/reward ratio and how will it get updated? The minimum ratio should be an integral of World Growth Rate from the work date to the payment date.

# Startup Funds

A system can start with three type of resources belief->work and belief->money.
* Someone might believe in the mahlas and can risk their time to invest. *That is what I'm doing now.*
* Someone might believe in the system and can risk their money.
* A previously created Mahlas can fund a new one. *Where will this surplus come form? Will we introduce a reproduction tax for the current Mahlas's?*

#Atom cost / Atomic task cost

* Calculated cost of a task based on external data. How much would it cost normally?
* Possible cost in the system based on people demand.

* Money available to invest.
* Amount of trust needed
    
# Trust / Risk of a creator

A mahlas will trust a creator based on those variables:
* Trust value of the referee
* Based on the total value generated before.
    * Every work generated will have a tax for retirement/trust fund.
    * When retirement fund is used this value will be recalculated.

The risk/trust value of the creator is a measurement for the possible top limit of the cost of a task they can apply for.

# Retirement / Leaving the System / Resetting the Trust

* A creator at any time can decide to leave the creating ecosystem.
* A creator can re-enter the ecosystem anytime they want.
* A creator can partially withdraw from the retirement fund which might effect their trust value.

# Tax

* Retirement fund :makes creators gain trust and totally refundable. Maybe in every task a creator can refund it directly with an option.
* Mahlas project running costs tax : should be minimal, and should have level higher levels for Mahlas's which have higher revenue.
* New artwork creation tax : This could be optionally decided in every Mahlas created.
* Reproduction tax : Not decided yet! A tax to support reproduction of new Mahlas's.
