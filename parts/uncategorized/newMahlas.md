This document should be a guide about how to start a new Mahlas based on real world examples.


# Description

Every Mahlas is a different feeling/algorithm/way to communicate which should explained in its Whitepaper upon creation.
A Whitepaper is similar to a DNA. Some Mahlas's could be similar to each other but just based on different localities. Creators interact and effect a Mahlas with every task they do or decision they make.

# White Paper

## Description

* Name
* Main language(s)
* Locality : Will the artist be a local one or else.
* Medium(s)
* Mahlas's medium or media should be decided
* Likes and dislikes of Mahlas could be added (for ex:This Mahlas hates bananas, loves cats)
* Political views
* Style of creation
* Creation speed
* Characteristics
* Variety in time *This could effect every other option*
* Chance factor *This could effect every other option*
* Reaction to populism in art

## Fitness Function

This list is not fixed. Some parts could be mandatory, some could be optional, at the end there should be a mathematical formula.

* Self Sustainability
* Fame
* Fame Quality *How will we calculate this?
* Visiblity compared to Local Politicians
* Creators statisfaction *How will this be calculated*
* Creators revenue

## Human Resources

* Reference based joining
* 2 references might be needed
* Free to everyone
* Relationship to other Mahlas's (inbound / outbound)
* Starting people (this could be assigned in the beginning)
* Does it have a board? (if there is a fixed number of people which has a different role, then there is a board)

## Communication
Every mahlas could have a different rule set on how the creators communicate.

* Fully decentralized
* Semi decentralized (for ex:occasional meetings)
* Centralized (same hub is used for creation, similar to classic art studios)

## Economy

### Funding

Funding can happen in two possible ways; time and money. These possibilities can happen partial and might happen at the same time.

A belief in a Mahlas is not a donation. It is a risk/reward system. *What is the risk/reward ratio and how will it get updated? The minimum ratio should be an integral of World Growth Rate from the work date to the payment date.

### Startup Funds

A system can start with three type of resources belief->work and belief->money.
* Someone might believe in the mahlas framework and can risk their time. *That is what I'm doing now.*
* Someone might believe in a mahlas and can risk their time.
* Someone might believe in a mahlas and can risk their money.
* Can get funds from a previous Mahlas, if possible.
* A previously created Mahlas can fund a new one. *Where will this surplus come form? Will we introduce a reproduction tax for the current Mahlas's?*

### Wages

* Minimum wage per hour
* Maximum wage per hour
* Fixed wage is possible if minimum wage is equal to maximum wage.
* Wage based on where the creator lives. (for ex: city average costs could be used)

### Trust / Risk of a creator

A mahlas will trust a creator based on those variables:
* Trust value of the referee
* Based on the total value generated before.
    * Every work generated will have a tax for retirement/trust fund.
    * When retirement fund is used this value will be recalculated.

The risk/trust value of the creator is a measurement for the possible top limit of the cost of a task they can apply for.

A referee can raise trust value of a referenced creator by landing some of its trust resources. *Probably referee must do it with a minimum cost.But that might create a problem for getting more creators, people might not want to reference so that system should favor referencing or at least have a policy for that.*


### Retirement / Leaving the System / Resetting the Trust

* A creator at any time can decide to leave a mahlas.
* A creator can re-enter the mahlas anytime they want, if possible.
* A creator can partially withdraw from the retirement fund which might effect their trust value.

### Tax

* Retirement fund :makes creators gain trust and totally refundable. Maybe in every task a creator can refund it directly with an option.
* Mahlas project running costs tax : should be minimal, and should have level higher levels for Mahlas's which have higher revenue.
    * Server cost / hosting etc.
    * Domain name renewal
* New artwork creation tax : This could be optionally decided in every Mahlas created.
* Reproduction tax : Not decided yet! A tax to support reproduction of new Mahlas's.


### Penalty

In case of task failure, retirement fund can be used for compensation. 


### Documentation
Every mahlas can decide how the process will be reported and to whom.

# Short Examples

## Real World Examples
