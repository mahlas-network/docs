This document should be a guide about how to start a new Mahlas based on real world examples.


# Description

Every Mahlas is a different feeling/algorithm/way to communicate which should explained in its Whitepaper upon creation.
A Whitepaper is similar to a DNA. Some Mahlas's could be similar to each other but just based on different localities. Creators interact and effect a Mahlas with every task they do or decision they make.

# White Paper

## Description

* Name
* Main language(s)
* Locality : Will the artist be a local one or else.
* Medium(s)
* Mahlas's medium or media should be decided
* Likes and dislikes of Mahlas could be added (for ex:This Mahlas hates bananas, loves cats)
* Political views
* Style of creation
* Creation speed
* Characteristics
* Variety in time *This could effect every other option*
* Chance factor *This could effect every other option*
* Reaction to populism in art

## Fitness Function

This list is not fixed. Some parts could be mandatory, some could be optional, at the end there should be a mathematical formula.

* Self Sustainability
   * Human Resources
   	* Total number of creators
	* Diversity of creators based on task types
	* Total and distribution trust of creators
   * Funding
   * Health (attacks on the system)
* Fame
* Fame Quality *How will we calculate this?
* Visiblity compared to Local Politicians
* Creators statisfaction *How will this be calculated*
* Creators revenue


## Human Resources

* Reference based joining
* 2 references might be needed
* Free to everyone
  * Any penalties?
  * Should they pay for it?
* Relationship to other Mahlas's (inbound / outbound)
* Starting people (this could be assigned in the beginning)
* Does it have a board? (if there is a fixed number of people which has a different role, then there is a board)
	* Can the board change?
	* Does it have a trust value?
	* Does individuals have a trust value?
	* Does it have roles? (Secretary / Counselor / Observer)
	* Can a board member suggest new potential board members?
	* Can a board member suggest expulsion of another board member?
	* Can a board member resign?
	* Can Mahlas suggest new potential board members?
	* Can Mahlas suggest expulsion vote for board members?
	* Can a board member suggest/force Mahlas a new artwork?
	* Can a board member suggest a creator?

	
### Approval of a real person
* If needed so how much does it cost ?
* Freud check - *can we check really if it is that person or someone else pretending to be ?


## Communication
Every mahlas could have a different rule set on how the creators communicate.

* Fully decentralized
* Semi decentralized (for ex:occasional meetings)
* Centralized (same hub is used for creation, similar to classic art studios)

### Possible Tools for Communication

For ex: 
* Decentralized mobile app, destroyed when no one has a copy of it.
* Produced device with assembily instructions on how to be copied.

## Execution

* Conflict Dilemma solving style
* Task atomizing
* Control mechanism for tasks
* Time management
  * If an assignment is not done in the planned time, how should the system should react ?
  * Extra Time ? If so how much ? 
  * Assignment Time Estimation Protocol
    * X number of people is asked to estimate the assignments time cost.
* Budget
  * Budget Estimation Protocol
    * X number of people is asked to estimate the assignments budget.
* Creator selection system
  * (PE) Prioritizing experienced member may - Lower the risk of assignment failure
  * (PI) Prioritizing inexperienced member may - Develop new members
*  Task Assignments Procedure

### Assignment Agencies
	
For ex: One person could handle assignments of other people, do not register them, be a member as a team. This might create problems, the fee might go to some people, we can call this “workflow tunneling”. This has some advantages for newcomers, like old people who can not use computer etc.


## Economy

### Funding

Funding can happen in two possible ways; time and money. These possibilities can happen partial and might happen at the same time.

A belief in a Mahlas is not a donation. It is a risk/reward system. *What is the risk/reward ratio and how will it get updated? The minimum ratio should be an integral of World Growth Rate from the work date to the payment date.

### Startup Funds

A system can start with three type of resources belief->work and belief->money.
* Someone might believe in the mahlas framework and can risk their time. *That is what I'm doing now.*
* Someone might believe in a mahlas and can risk their time.
* Someone might believe in a mahlas and can risk their money.
* Can get funds from a previous Mahlas, if possible.
* A previously created Mahlas can fund a new one. *Where will this surplus come form? Will we introduce a reproduction tax for the current Mahlas's?*

### Wages

* Minimum wage per hour
* Maximum wage per hour
* Fixed wage is possible if minimum wage is equal to maximum wage.
* Wage based on where the creator lives. (for ex: city average costs could be used)

### Trust / Risk of a creator

A mahlas will trust a creator based on those variables:
* Trust value of the referee
* Based on the total value generated before.
    * Every work generated will have a tax for retirement/trust fund.
    * When retirement fund is used this value will be recalculated.

The risk/trust value of the creator is a measurement for the possible top limit of the cost of a task they can apply for.

A referee can raise trust value of a referenced creator by landing some of its trust resources. *Probably referee must do it with a minimum cost.But that might create a problem for getting more creators, people might not want to reference so that system should favor referencing or at least have a policy for that.*


### Retirement / Leaving the System / Resetting the Trust

* A creator at any time can decide to leave a mahlas.
* A creator can re-enter the mahlas anytime they want, if possible.
* A creator can partially withdraw from the retirement fund which might effect their trust value.

### Tax

* Retirement fund :makes creators gain trust and totally refundable. Maybe in every task a creator can refund it directly with an option.
* Mahlas project running costs tax : should be minimal, and should have level higher levels for Mahlas's which have higher revenue.
    * Server cost / hosting etc.
    * Domain name renewal
* New artwork creation tax : This could be optionally decided in every Mahlas created.
* Reproduction tax : Not decided yet! A tax to support reproduction of new Mahlas's.


### Penalty

In case of task failure, retirement fund can be used for compensation. 


### Documentation

Documentation could be needed for press, accounting, transparency or for other reasons.

* Every mahlas can decide how the process will be reported and to whom.
* Will the Mahlas have a memory? If so how?

### Maintenance

* How will the system be maintained?
* Who will do it? Is it fixed?
* Maintenance Task Creation
	* Based on requests to improve the work system
	* System will gather feedbacks on all steps
 


# Short Examples

## Real World Examples

* Deniz Yılmaz
* Banksy
