* It means a pseudonym for a poet.
* It also means a shelter for salvation.

# Grey Areas

* If a mahlas would get an official money, how will the receipt be created? That should probably be different for every mahlas to keep the system decentralized.
  * Should the system force every contributer to a blockchain based money ?

# Ways to interact with the Mahlas Framework

## Become a Creator!
* reference code
* data from the shepherd
* prioritize creation by time / location / work type / artist

## Create your own Mahlas

This feels like one person has to create a Mahlas oneself but this is not the case. Maybe there could be a general agenda on Mahlas Ecosystem based on population / type / location etc. And all Mahlas's can be created from that part

* would like to browse already created Mahlas's?
* why would you create a Mahlas?

* location based
* conception based
* language based
