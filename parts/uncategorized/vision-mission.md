Mahlas is an artwork, an organization creation framework.

Mahlas is build to disrupt the current understanding of creation process by experimenting temporary trustless organizations.  
As people who start this experiment, we believe that decentralization and autonomy can not be achieved on a static body therefore we embrace temporality and evolvability. While exploring the boundaries of non-anthropocentric existence we value creators and hybrids.

# Vision

To experiment on collaborative creation and togetherness.

# Mission

To establish a platform for creating organization blueprints.


# Values

Mahlas is architected to support transparency, collaboration without borders and diversity by producing copyleft, allocentric, forkable, non-anthropocentric and temporal experiences.
