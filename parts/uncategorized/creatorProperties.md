* referees code : 
Can anyone join without a reference ? 
What would be the penalties ?
Is there a cost for a new applied creator ? if so they can pay it to raise their trust value . (approval of a real person) Maybe we can do it after they do some creation.
* reference code : could we have different trust values for the references?
* data from the shepherd
* location could be gps coordinates
* prioritize creation by time / location / creation type / artist
* trust value
* task completation statistics
* speed
* quality of the creations
* wage per hour / wage per minute
* subjects interested in
