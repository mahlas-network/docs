This document should be a guide about how to start a new Mahlas based on real world examples.


# Description

Every Mahlas is a different feeling/algorithm/way to communicate which should explained in its Whitepaper upon creation.
A Whitepaper is similar to a DNA. Some Mahlas's could be similar to each other but just based on different localities.
* Any Mahlas can have a speed of change which will define how they might change in time.
* Creators interact and effect a Mahlas with every task they do or decision they make.
