# Join the Creator / Maker / Producer Force

* reference code

# Create your own Mahlas

This feels like one person has to create a Mahlas oneself but this is not the case. Maybe there could be a general agenda on Mahlas Ecosystem based on population / type / location etc. And all Mahlas's can be created from that part

* why would you create a Mahlas?

* location based
* conception based
