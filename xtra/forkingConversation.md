# forking conversation: peer and bager akbay on mahlas

**peer :** could you tell me about your new work, mahlas,  you have recently started working on? 

**bager :** I do not know much about what I am doing and why I am doing it. It is more like a feeling rather than an idea but I will do my best to explain it. After "Deniz Yılmaz", it became more clear that I enjoy the process a lot more than the result, I can even say that I am not interested in the result at all, I do not believe in it. Ok, there is a history of things we have done but even it changes everytime we talk about but that's all there is nothing more. So I started to dive more into the process of Deniz Yılmaz and Mahlas is a way to make this more public. It is about how we made a community school, it is about how I am trying prevent earning money from art, it is about how I can stand the political change in local and in the world, it is about weirdos, queers, monsters, it is about not playing the game but introducing/experimenting a new one.

In simple terms, Mahlas is a way of creating art together.

**peer :** you have  created a repository on github and uploaded first draft text, what i would call the protocol for the work. how will it work and how are you planning to schedule the rest of the process? what will the further stages be?

**bager :** I wanted to be more transparent on the process, and create less possible space for myself to prevent self-speculation. That's why I want almost everything (just considering other peoples privacy) to be public. I will just continue to add things that I have thought, and history of the repository will show how the project changes in time.

Every part will be public, after the framework is at least a bit clear, I will start writing all the code here and you will see how a code could be ugly :) I am ok with being a terrible coder. 

Being public also pushes me to continue the project which shows that I have a strong barrier I have to fight. I think that is just about embracing the unknown but doing it in a nice way. That is so hard for me, I am trying to be as non-anthropomorphic as I can but still trying to keep the artistic performance alive. I know this process is the performance. Every key stroke, push, pull, commit is a part of it.

**peer :** how do you imagine the journey of the work? how do you think people will react and relate to it during this process and once it is finished? how do you imagine it being public? in exhibitions? how should it be exhibited? what will it be in 10 years?

**bager :** Well I seriously doubt if people will use it for a long time maybe ever, I don't think it will be understood until it grows big, if it does. Mahlas will not be accepted for a long time, but when it starts, to work outcomes will be understood, I guess.

To be more clear, the framework (the idea) is worth reading/investigating if it creates strange outcomes. We will have to wait for that.

Ten years is impossible to guess for me, I think in one year we will see some outcomes and improvise from that point on as we always do.

**peer :** how do you read this work? what are your personal references and motivations? how excited are you about it now?

**bager :** It is just my reflection on how the world is changing, it is a reaction which is not controlled. My starting points are very simple and  familiar to most of the people around me. I am trying to understand the world politics, I dream about how I want to produce, live, I also include my daughters dreams, every comment she makes about the world is very important to me, I took them as serious as I can. 

And yes, I am a bit too much excited about it.


**peer :** could you also tell me about other things that occupy your mind these days? what else will you be working/thinking on while you develop this work further?

**bager :** I am trying to get away from the other things I am doing, and concentrate on Mahlas, so that no I do not want to talk about them. Just some related parts, like how we work in democratic schools in Turkey (BBOM) or how we make decisions in our atelie (iskele47). These structures have parts in this project. It may sound or feel like I am trying to create an out of world system but no, every decision I make in Mahlas is a reflection of the things I am in.
