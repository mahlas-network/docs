# forking conversation: peer and bager akbay on mahlas

peer: could you tell me about your new work, mahlas,  you have recently started working on? 


peer: you have  created a repository on github and uploaded first draft text, what i would call the protocol for the work. how will it work and how are you planning to schedule the rest of the process? what will the further stages be?

peer: how do you imagine the journey of the work? how do you think people will react and relate to it during this process and once it is finished? how do you imagine it being public? in exhibitions? how should it be exhibited? what will it be in 10 years?

peer: how do you read this work? what are your personal references and motivations? how excited are you about it now?

peer: could you also tell me about other things that occupy your mind these days? what else will you be working/thinking on while you develop this work further?
